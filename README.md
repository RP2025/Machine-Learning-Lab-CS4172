## üß™ Assignments Overview

Each assignment is designed to give you a hands-on experience of implementing various machine learning algorithms:

1. **Assignment01**: Linear Regression and basic exploratory data analysis (EDA). The goal is to explore the relationship between variables and implement linear regression models.
2. **Assignment02**: Logistic Regression for classification problems. This assignment focuses on binary classification and model evaluation using logistic regression.
3. **Assignment03**: Decision Trees and Random Forests. Here, we implement and explore decision trees and ensemble methods such as random forests for improved performance.
4. **Assignment04**: Support Vector Machines (SVMs) and exploring kernel functions. Learn how SVMs can be used for complex data classification.
5. **Assignment05**: Clustering using the K-Means algorithm. This assignment covers unsupervised learning where you will apply clustering techniques to group data based on similarities.
